        <p>Java, an object-oriented programming language, was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Here’s a concise overview of Java’s history:

            Early Years (1991-1995)
            
            June 1991: The project, initially called “Green,” was started to develop a programming language for consumer electronic devices, such as smart TVs, set-top boxes, and handheld controllers.
            1992: The language was renamed “Oak” (after the oak tree), and the file extension was changed to .gt.
            1993: The team considered multiple names, including DNA, Silk, and Ruby, before settling on Java. <font>20</font></p>
